Overview

.proto files are automatically generated by a build, as defined in the .csproj project file.
The scaffolded code is output into the obj directory. An asbtract base class is created for each service method in the .proto file

CSharp source code can then be written to inherit from this class.

GRpc service is writeen for communicating between Aggregate and Domain models. Thus, converting between GRpc command and domain model
commands and DTOs.
